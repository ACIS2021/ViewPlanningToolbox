class BaseEnv:
    """Abstract base class for environments to be interacted with by agents.

    This class is what `gym.Env` is to OpenAI gym: it defines the basic interface
    required to be implemented by all Blender environments.

    Blender defines a callback based animation system. This also affects `BaseEnv` in that it
    requires the agent to be given by a callable method having following signature:
        cmd, action = agent(env, **kwargs)
    The arguments passed via **kwargs are at least `obs`, `reward`, `done`. Other variables
    correspond to additional information (`info` dict in OpenAI). The agent is expected to
    return a command (BaseEnv.CMD_RESTART or BaseEnv.CMD_STEP) with an optional `action`
    to perform. Note, `action`, `obs`, `reward` and `info` depend on the actual environment
    implementation.

    Since a callback based agent is unusual to OpenAI users, blendtorch offers a
    `RemoteControlledAgent`, that communicates with a remotly implemented agent. The remote
    agent can then be implements with the common blocking: `agent.step()`, `agent.restart()`.
    See `blendtorch.btt` for details.

    Each environment inheriting from `BaseEnv`needs to implement the following three methods
     - `BaseEnv._env_reset()` to reset environment state to initial
     - `BaseEnv._env_prepare_step(action) to apply an action in a pre-frame manner.
     - `BaseEnv._env_post_step()` to gather the environment state, reward and other variables
        after the frame has completed (i.e after physics, and animation have computed their values).
